As he quickly ran through the bushes, he spotted a big plate of spaghetti left on the ground. Joe couldn't resist and dove in, scarfing down the noodles, twirling them around like a pro, while his car waited impatiently.\n",

As Joe tried to regain control, a cat leaped onto the windshield, giving him a big talk about driving safely. Out of the blue, a doctor emerged from one of the nearby buildings, wearing a stethoscope around his neck, and began to perform CPR on the car, much to everyone's confusion and amusement. In the end, Joe realized it was all just a dream when his mom yelled, \"Joe, wake up! You fell asleep at the dinner table again!\"\n"
